This Github repo explores the methodology involved in creating a real-time American sign language (ASL) letters classifier. 

To be able to successfully classify images into letters we propose an Internet-of-things (IoT) system which takes in images in real time and passes these images to a server which then performs the necessary computing by way of machine learning and returns the classified letter. Our final product is able to successfully classify letters in real time at up to 30 frames per second. This proof of concept paves the way for more complex classification involving ASL, such as using words instead of letters to improve the speed of communication.
